# Tech-Mania Reborn

#### **With over 200 mods, Its not a lightweight pack!**

- At least 4-6GB of RAM allocated to the pack
- A decent CPU

If you game crashes while launching and the crash log has a line like Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded or Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space, it's because the game has run out of RAM. Tech-Mania Reborn needs a minimum of 4 gigabytes—but ideally 6—to run.

Go to Twitch settings and make sure the amount of RAM is at least 5 or 6 gigabytes:
